	<h1>Migrating from Spring Dynamic Modules to Eclipse Gemini Blueprint</h1>
	
	
	<p>This guide is aimed at helping developers using Spring DM in their application to migrate to Eclipse Gemini Blueprint. Note that the migration 
	to the Eclipse Foundation is not yet complete and this document might not reflect all the changes that occurred in the process. See the 
	support page for more info on getting accurate information.</p>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Gemini Blueprint was created through the migration of Spring Dynamic Modules to the Eclipse Foundation. While certain things have
	changed in the process, mainly to reflect the new project name and hosting infrastructure, the project architecture, ideas, code base and dependencies
	have remained intact. Use this to your advantage when encountering errors, by looking first for references to 'old' packages or classes as these are likely
	to be the problem in the vast majority of cases.
	</p>
	
	<h2>1.0.0.M1</h2>
	
	<h3>Changed Package Name</h3>
	<p>The most disruptive change for Spring DM users when transitioning to Gemini Blueprint is the renaming of the project packages: 
	from <tt>org.springframework.osgi</tt> to <tt>org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint</tt>. If you are referring to the Spring DM classes, in any way,
	either inside Java code or XML configuration, you need to update the package.<br/>
	The actual class names and method signatures have <b>not</b> been changed so in most cases the changed can be accommodated through a simple "search & replace"
	operation.<br/>
	Note that for configuration purposes, one can shield itself from the package change by relying on the Spring DM/Eclipse Gemini Blueprint namespaces 
	which hide the actual classes used for configuring, making the change transparent.	 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Manifest updates</h3>
	<p>Inherent to the package name changes, the manifests have been updated as well. Besides changing the imported package names as indicated above, the imported version should be
	modified to <tt>1.0.0</tt> (or <tt>1.0.0.M1</tt> for wiring only to the M1 artifact).
	
	<h3>Changed Namespace/Schema Location</h3>
	<p>While not yet implemented in M1, the existing Spring DM schema definition (named <tt>spring-osgi.xsd</tt> and located at <tt>http://www.springframework.org/schema/osgi</tt>)
	will be renamed and moved according to the existing Eclipse patterns. For M1, developers can still rely on the old location or, if versioning is used, use <tt>spring-osgi-2.0.0.m2</tt>.
	Be advised that this <b>will change</b> in the upcoming releases.
	
	<h3>Removed deprecated classes</h3>
	<p>During the move, several deprecated or unused classes have been removed. If you cannot find a class name in the new package, it's likely that it has been removed in the process. Feel free
	to confirm this over the forums. Once the migration completes, we plan to provide a complete list of classes removed in this document.</p>

	<h3>Removed deprecated modules</h3>
	<p>As of M1, not all modules or projects inside Spring DM have been moved. At the moment only the <tt>io</tt>, <tt>core</tt>, <tt>extender</tt> and <tt>test</tt> modules have transitioned
	are provided in M1. With the up-coming release of OSGi RFC-66, the web support is being discontinued. Existing users are encouraged to look at Eclipse Gemini Web 
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/gemini/blueprint/">project</a>. The plans for the Maven archetype and annotation extension are undefined for the moment.</p>
	
	<h3>Changed Maven artifact groupId/artifactId and repository</h3>
	<p>The Maven artifacts have changed as well during the transition. For the time being, the artifacts are hosted at a new repository (<tt>zodiac.springsource.com</tt>):
	  <pre>
  &lt;repository&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;zodiac-repository&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Zodiac Milestone Repository&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;http://zodiac.springsource.com/maven/bundles/milestone&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/repository&gt;
  	 </pre>
    The groupId has changed from <tt>org.springframework.osgi</tt> to <tt>org.eclipse.gemini.blueprint</tt> and artifactId from <tt>spring-osgi-*</tt> to <tt>gemini-blueprint-*</tt> (e.g.
    <tt>spring-osgi-core</tt> is now <tt>gemini-blueprint-core</tt>).		
	</p>
	
	<p>The content and names of the artifacts have remained mainly unchanged.</p>
