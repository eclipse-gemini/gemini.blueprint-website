	<h2>Developers, want to contribute ?</h2>
	<p>
		Download Gemini Blueprint and take it for a spin. Read the docs. Check out and build the code. Then tweet, blog, or post to the 
		<a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/gemini-dev"> developer mailing list</a> It's as simple as that. 
		Maybe later you'll want to file 
		<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced;order=Importance;product=Gemini.Blueprint">
		bugs</a> or send in patches to the docs and code.
