	Eclipse Gemini Blueprint is the reference implementation for the <a href="http://www.osgi.org">OSGi Alliance</a> Blueprint Service (chapter 121 of the OSGi 4.2 Compendium Specification).

Gemini Blueprint project makes it easy to build Java applications that run in an OSGi framework. By using Gemini Blueprint, applications benefit from using a better separation of modules, the ability to dynamically add, remove, and update modules in a running system, the ability to deploy multiple versions of a module simultaneously (and have clients automatically bind to the appropriate one), and a dynamic service model.

Gemini users may also be interested in Eclipse <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/virgo">Virgo</a>, an open source, completely modular, OSGi-based Java application server. Its documentation is considered a supplement to Gemini Blueprint as it explains in detail, how OSGi can be used in various development and production scenarios.
